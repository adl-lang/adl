ADL (Algebraic Data Language)
================================

*Consistent data everywhere!*

A framework for building cross language data models. It consists of a DSL for describing data types,
code generators for several target languages, and runtimes for these languages.

* [introduction][] - an overview of the ADL system
* [language][] - a description of the ADL language
* [compiler][] - the command line compiler
* [serialization][] - how ADL types are serialized
* Language support:
    * [haskell][]
    * [java][]
    * [typescript][]
    * [c++][cpp]
    * [rust][]
* [install][] - installation instructions

Also see the [adl-demo][] repository, which contains working demonstrations of ADL usage.
